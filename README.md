
Project Title: Smart Helmet

In challenging work environments, the safety and well-being of workers are
paramount concerns. These settings present a myriad of risks, including physical
injury and psychological stress, which can have long-lasting impacts on individuals.
One particular area of concern is the inadequacy of existing head protection solutions,
which do not offer effective monitoring of worker health status and lack the capability
for rapid communication and response. In such environments, work managers and
supervisors also face significant challenges in monitoring and managing the
workforce effectively, there have been many cases of work accidents caused by not
complying with safety standards at work, especially in the use of safety helmets. This
study is able to make regular observations in identifying project personnel using
safety helmets at work, this aims to reduce the risk of accidents at work, namely in
the use of helmet attributes at work.
