  In challenging work environments, the safety and well-being of workers are paramount concerns. These settings present a myriad of risks, including physical injury and psychological stress, which can have long-lasting impacts on individuals. One particular area of concern is the inadequacy of existing head protection solutions, which do not offer effective monitoring of worker health status and lack the capability for rapid communication and response. In such environments, work managers and supervisors also face significant challenges in monitoring and managing the workforce effectively, there have been many cases of work accidents caused by not complying with safety standards at work, especially in the use of safety helmets. This study can make regular observations in identifying project personnel using safety helmets at work, this aims to reduce the risk of accidents at work, namely in the use of helmet attributes at work. Workers strive hard to satisfy their daily requirements, but sometimes the workplace environment is never on their side, in difficult work environments, workers face many risks including physical injury and psychological stress. Current head protection solutions do not provide effective monitoring of worker health status and lack rapid communication and rapid response capabilities. Work managers and supervisors also suffer from problems with the staff in terms of monitoring them and managing the work well.[2] Furthermore, work managers and supervisors encounter difficulties in effectively monitoring and managing the workforce due to the absence of real-time data on the health and well-being of their staff, making their working circumstances terrible. This lack of insight can impede decision-making processes and compromise the overall safety and efficiency of operations.

launching instructions:
For the website, download all the files in a folder and then open it in a IDE that supports web languages, such as Visual Studio, NetBeans, etc. We needed the composer to be able to load libraries in php like: PHPMailer.
For the Arduino, Open the Arduino file in Arduino, but the devices used in this project must be available.
